    "guestReview": "Clean and the food is fantastic. The apartment is very spacious and the furniture is out of solid wood. However the bathroom has left the impression that they run out of money. I've seen a single or double room which was small, don't know about the others. A very good place to stay though the mattresses could be better."

    "guestReview": " This place is wonderful, the rooms are clean with big and comfy bed, the restaurant offers traditional romanian food, very tasty, totally worth the money. The landscapes are magnificent, you have enough place to walk around the hotel, or to have sport. Highly recomended! "
